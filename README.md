# Sharp

### Note:
- I did not say this is good or that C# is good for this kind of stuff.

### Features

- Go into Lobby.


### Todo
- Add profiles.
- Do all MCP Commands.
- Proper Account handling.
- Matchmaking.

### Note
- Backend might not be that good as i just started doing C#
- Backend is still faster than LawinServer somehow? C# might be a 🐐
- idk if i will work onto that that much its more like a side project.

### Public Ussage
- If anyone decides on using this backend pls credit me :D
